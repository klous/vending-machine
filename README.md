# vending-machine
A vending machine program written in Java as a pair project during week 4 of Tech Elevator

###  This pair project was used to demonstrate and solidify our understanding of basic Java skills learned up to this point

 - Working with objects
 - Collections like lists and maps
 - Arrays and loops
 - Unit Testing using Junit
 - Handling Exceptions - we decided to create and implement a custom exception
 - Opening files, reading them, and writing to files for logging or audit purposes
 - Taking in user input from the console and doing handling their user input appropriately
 - Using principles of OOP - Object-Oriented Programming when possible

 
 Working with BigDecimal was not required but we used it throughout the project
